0ozlems,Amazing view,40,We walked up the hill from narrow streets to the monastery. It was quite crowded but worth it. They give you clothes if your clothing is not appropriate to enter the monastery.,6-Aug-17
123arthura,Exceptional,50,You can't leave Patmos without seeing the Monastery!  It dates from the 12th century and I dedicated to St. John (the cave where he wrote the Apocalypse) is further down the hill.    There's a museum (€2) that has great relics and amazing artifacts!    Parking is available on the road at the entrance of Chora (the town at the top of the hill),8-Aug-16
355stevez,Great site,50,Plenty to see at site and in museum. Lots of steps up but worth the climb. Take the time to see the chapel and church.,19-Oct-18

422aldiss,A place to see,40,Walking through the narrow streets of Hora in the vicinity of the monastery. A wonderful view of the island from the top of the monastery.,2-Oct-14
52julieB,Nice place to visit,30,Impressive from the outside but not a lot to see once inside. A few nice photos to take and if you are religious the few areas of the monastery devoted to religion are ok,13-Sep-15
64leannej,Breath taking views,50,You can take the bus from the town square or hike up if you are very fit worth the trip a lovely serene place . With one of the most important museums in the world . The views from the top are spectacular,29-Apr-16
65YvonneT,Inspiring,50,For the Christian believer this is truly an inspiring place to visit. As is the cave where St John received the revelation from God. Unforgettable experience!,11-May-14
678andyb,Interesting and worth the visit,50,"Obe of the main sites to visit in Patmos and definitely worthwhile. The museum is extremely interesting especially (for me) the remains of the old temple of artemis formerly on the site, which was an unexpected find. Nice to see the monks around and pleased that most visitors were respectfully dressed given for many this is a very holy site.",30-Jul-18
777oddh,The crown of the jewel.,40,"Monastery of Saint John the Divine, sits on the hilltop above Skala harbor in the town called Chora(Khora) as a crown on the beautiful island of Patmos. It is a Greek Orthodox monastery founded in 1088, and is a ""must"" if you are on the island. It is listed on UNESCO`s World Heritage list and has a spectacular collection of icons and costly items. It is supposed to have a pact of defense with Katharina the Great of Russia. The monastery has, among its relics, the skull of Saint Thomas the Apostle, something I personally find strange, since he probably died in southern parts of India. But a visit is of great interest for people looking for more than just a leisure holliday.",29-Sep-15
824carlad,The Theological school,40,Where the theological school was established in 1713 .Its dark façade provides a contrast with its interior. There you may visit some of the 5 chapels and the old treasury in a museum.,25-Jun-16
837louisek,Monastery in a quaint town,40,"I could see the monastery when our ferry was approaching the island. Make sure to obtain a map of the island even though it's not that big. The monastery is in the Hora area of the island and at the top of the hill. As you ascend the stairs that leads to the entrace, someone will take your picture which you may purchase for 4 euros after yours visit. A 4.00 euro entry fee will let you into the monastery with a museum. The inside of the church is quite ornate and filled with wall murals of religious figures and scenes. To me, it is all very gaudy. The museum is full of religious icons, gospels, some marble fragments, etc. It's worth a visit, as it's a UNESCO site. If you don't have the proper attire, there are shawls available to cover up. Parking is a bit tight, so may be go there in early morning. Check opening hours as they may be closed in some afternoons. Plenty of restaurants and souvenirs close by.",13-Aug-15
84roelv,nice place with nice views,50,"When in Patmos you must visit the Monastery of St. John.  It is located in Chora, 4,5 kilometers from Skala. You can take a hike up the hill or go by bus, car or scooter. Nice place to visit with nice views.",26-May-18
894vesnai,By cruise...,50,"I was by Celestyal Olympia cruiser, do I spent just 4 hours on the island  Enough to see, to feel piecfullnes at Monastery and museum.  4€ and 2€  Really have to see. Taxi is 40€(30€)  So, 4 of us split..  Such a Top ""to do"" thing on Patmos  I recommend deeply",26-Oct-19
920katerinap,Wonderful building on the top of the Chora,50,"Wonderful old monastery with treasures not only in icons and religious objects but also in old books. Apart from the churches the museum is a must to see. And the views are amazing! In the right side of the main church is the Chapel of Virgin Mary. Look for the icon on the temple ""Η ΚΥΡΙΑ ΤΩΝ ΑΓΓΕΛΩΝ"". And enjoy the architecture and frescoes of the monastery. For Greek people the entrance is free, the museum has an entrance ticket of EUR2.",26-Jul-15
975kimberleys,St Johns Monastery,40,"Very beautiful place to visit. Not much to do when inside, few churches and a very nice museum but a nice place for pictures. Museum has so many old artifacts, books from 6ad etc. Very nice and peaceful place to visit. 4euro entry to monastery and 6euro entry to the museum.    Ladies to cover legs when inside the monastery, they provide shawls there to wrap around you.    30 monks still live inside the monastery",19-Nov-14
abcreviewer,A must see if visitng Hora!,40,"The monastery dominates Hora and you can see it from Scala. We walked to Hora from Grikos, along the donkey trails, past the goat farms - a trek but worth it. We hadn't decided whether to go in but, for 4 euros, it seemed a no brainer. It isn't too big which helps but varied enough to keep it interesting. You also have acces to the museum with your ticket and again, not too big but with some interesting exhibits. Hora, is a quaint village, with amazing restored windmils as well as the monastery and a must if you are in Patmos.",25-Jun-13
abyayala,A Must see!,50,"Regardless of being an Orthodox, or even a religious person, a visit in the Monastery of st John (and the Cave of the Apocalypse as well), is an absolute must when visiting Patmos.    The Monastery itself is so impressive and seductive when looking at it from the port, that it really invites you to visit it.    It is a beautiful, really interesting place to see, not only in terms of religious or historical value, but also as a construction and landscape.    The visit will last a couple of hours and it's really worth visiting the small museum as well. The price is minimal (2 euros)    It would be nice to read some information about the history of the place before going up for a visit.    Also, a breathtaking view from the top, the Aegean landscape at its best :)",12-Aug-14
AIPPiraeus,absolute orthodox religion!!!!!,50,"It is the place where, according to the orthodox religion, God inspired St. John to write the Apocalypse...No words can tell...",15-Sep-15
Alan R,Well worth the climb,40,"For Believers, knowing that Paul was exiled here in 95 AD, a visit to Patmos has special meaning. And a climb up to the Monastery of St. John is a ""must do"". It's a popular attraction and can get rather congested, so have some patience and you'll be rewarded in a good many ways.",24-Nov-18
AlanD411,Historic and impressive,50,"There has been a presence on this site for 2,500 years. The monastery has been developed over centuries and is still a centre for monks praying and contemplating.  The huge building dominates the island and is visible for miles around.  Inside there is a real sense of thoughtfulness and respect for Christianity..  Bus timings a little awkward but for Euro 1.80 amazing value. Taxi home was Euro7.  Monastery now a World Heritage Site and once you see the height, depth and sheer size of the defensive walls it’s easy to see why this monument should be preserved.",5-Jul-19
Alex H,Mystical and historical place,50,"Before deciding to go there check if there is a cruise ship in the bay, if yes, it's better to choose another hour or day. You need peace and silence to feel the step of history and Christianity climbing the stairs until the Holy Monastery.  There are precious relics, marvelous icons and wood carved altars built during various centuries and each of them have survived through occupations and plunders.  Being in Patmos this is a must visit.",20-Aug-18
Alex J,"Unmissable, if you visit Patmos !! Combine this with a visit to the cave.",50,"My wife and I were very happy that our ship, the MV Celestyal Olympia, visited Patmos, on a cruise around the Greek Islands. As practising Catholics, we looked forward to seeing the cave where St. John wrote the Book of Revelation. We took an optional tour (paid tour). The tour took us first to the cave, then to this magnificent monastery on top of the hill. While the cave had a lot religious significance, this monastery was a real sightseeing gem. Wonderful location, great views, and plenty of history. (it is 1000 years old, whereas St. John lived in the cave, in exile, over 1900 years ago). There is a fantastic little museum, where you can see some very interesting church treasures, including the document signed by the Byzantine Emperor Alexis in 1088, establishing this monastery. As we had taken a paid tour, we had an excellent guide, who gave us an enormous amount of information. She also pointed out the best places to get photos. The views are stunning. One caution: your transport cannot take you right up to the entrance, it will need to park a fair way below. So, there is some climbing involved. If it is rainy, the cobblestones will be slippery and dangerous. Not a place to take a stroller!",18-Apr-20
alisonsM6413UD,Chora is heavenly and the monastery is part of its vibe,50,Definitely worth visiting whilst you explore Chora. There's a chapel plus two flours of interesting exhibits,28-Sep-20
AlQTravels,Amazing Collection of Art and History at this Hilltop Sanctuary,50,"Spent a little time walking the streets of the little port village, the Skala, on Patmos before taking a short bus ride up the hill to a stop below the Monastery. Great views of this lovely island from the bus stop and then a short but steep hike up to the entrance. The small museum has an incredible assortment of ancient religious artifacts. stuff that's been at this spot for nearly a thousand years. We were there late morning, so the crowds had thinned out, but watch the times since they close pretty early in the day. We walked back down to the Cave of the Apocalypse, which was a nice little serene hike through the trees and brush. A visit to this Monastery gives one a feeling of the early days of Christianity, and gives one a sense of being relatively close to the Holy Land.",6-Jul-17
AlWinterField,Serene and cool admist the heat of the Aegean,40,"Working monastery, cool and comforting, great architecture. You need to be respectful with clothing, cameras and manners. Small museum with some interesting pieces. Well worth 4 Euros",10-Jul-17
annibear,Great view,50,We caught the bus up to the top road then walked the rest of the way up the hill . You have to pay to go inside but well worth it. We looked round for about an hour it was very impressive we liked the place . We saw a donkey track on the way up so decided to walk down to the port on the way back.,28-Jul-19
Antonis2,Exceptional Holy visit,50,"Anyone who visit Patmos island MUST visit this Holy place! Patmos is well known for this specific Holy monastery. Serenity and highly respected religious relics. I'm sure you will feel the ""energy"" of this Holy place.",7-Jul-16
AthensVoyager,Impressive,50,"The monastery is a must see in Patmos. It is a holy place for Greeks that visit it all year around. Even if you are not very religious or Christian it is still interesting. While chatting with a shopkeeper (outside of the monastery) I was informed that many people from other religions are also visiting the place. The view from the monastery is breathtaking. Apart from the momastery itself, i found the museum very interesting. Try to go early in the morning to avoid the crowds and heat.",4-Sep-15
Aussiebooklover,A thousand photos later.....,50,"Got the hire car and set off for the monastery and holy cave of St John. The road was very steep amd narrow. Went to the cave first and into the chapel inside it. Couldn't take pictures but bought postcards. Very large comfortable cave with a fairly small building over it. Amazing to think that this where St John dictated the book of Revelations. Great views of Patmos from here.    Then drove even further up this steep road to the top where the monastery is. It's a beautiful building, all white washed walls, brilliant bougainvillea, and little courtyards. Took lots of photos, the view was even better here. The museum in the monastery has some very ancient books with beautiful decorations and pictures.    There are lots of shops on the steep narrow road that leads between old buildings from the car park to the monastery . We browsed in a few, and when we came down, stopped for lunch at a cafe overlooking the view, which was lovely. Had nice omelettes and a salad.",19-Nov-13
aussiegreynomad51,STUNNING,50,"A definite MUST SEE in Patmos. This UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE Greek Orthodox Monastery was founded in 1088. It has amazing frescoes painted on ceilings and walls from 11th century, stunning religious relics, and a definite sereeness about it. It is huge and takes a few hours to see it all. Well worth it. After go to Jimmy's Balcony Restaurant nearby for lunch it's great.",25-Aug-19
Aussies11,"History, scenery and faith.",50,"As you walk up the hill to the Monastery a photographer takes your photo and after your visit you can purchase the photo for 8 Euro each, quite a nice way to remember your visit. Even looking up at the Monastery from Skala makes you realise how impressive it is, and also wonder how they built it. Seeing it inside of course makes all the difference, we stopped at many points in the main monastery and specially enjoyed the museum which is the second part of the site. In the museum you can see ancient manuscripts, icons, tapestries and much more, and it is not just about the religious side but deepens knowledge of the historical events of the time.",30-Jul-19
barbara1932,Great Monastery!!,50,"The Monastery is on the top of the hill,with amazing views ,worth seeing! Read the history about the St.John and the revelations before you go... The bus is only 1.50 euro and we walk back is downhill and enjoy taking pictures all the way to the village.",24-Jul-13
Bathman,Awesome!,50,"We were here over the Easter weekend, and joined in several of the celebrations. All a great combination of reverence and joy!",27-May-17
becky248,Visit in the morning - stunning monastry,50,We got the 7.45 bus from Patmos to visit and arrived just as the monastry was being opened and had the place to ourselves. It is a beautiful monastry and the views are so impressive.,22-Jul-18
Belangelie,Worth to visit,50,"It is highly worthy to visit this monastery, which combines the church where can see important paintings with moments from Orthodox Bible history and the museum with unique items of great historical importance.",7-Jul-17
Beverly P,Absolutely a must see!!,50,"Wow, the views from up at the monastery are some of the best in Greece! Incredible to see this and of course the Cave of the Apocalypse which it surrounds. To think that Revelations was inspired and written here! incredible!",24-Jul-14
Bill S,Amazing and inspiring,50,"How do you rate a monastery like this established in the late 11th Century? Amazing. We prayed here and had a good time of reflection in this serene place. As an aside, I personally appreciated patting the monastery cat.",29-Oct-18
Bill T,Astonshing,50,"Beautiful monastery and chapel, with a breathtaking collection in the museum and an incredible history in a spectacular setting.",28-Jul-15
brendan c,Awesome view,50,Go early to avoid the crowds at this wonderful inspirational place with the most fantastic views. The museum is worth a visit Xmas the town of Chora is charming with plenty of decent shops and Tavernas.,21-May-19
Brian R,Breathtaking,50,"Absolutely astounding! The structure itself dates back to the 1080's and is beautifully maintained. It is mindboggling that services have been held here in an unbroken line since then. The church proper is beautiful and serene, and the museum was a surprisingly good experience. Among other artifacts they have a manuscript of the gospel of Matthew from the 6th century on display! Also artifacts showing the connection between Patmos and the monastery and the Ottoman Empire. There a some must sees on Patmos, and this definitely is one of them.",23-Jul-17
Bu57dal,Stunning Monastery and views,50,"I have been going to this Monastery since July 2014. Well worth visiting. A, ""Do not miss "" if you're in Patmos. The ticket is only 4 Euros, this includes visit to Museum. Please respect proper attire when visiting and no photographs only in the courtyard or the roof, the Greeks are very touchy about this and quiet right. Apart from the flashes damaging ancient art work, it's a holy place in fact, Patmos, once an island of exile is now a Holy Island. Lovely little shops to buy souvenirs, lots of interesting things to look at. Don't miss the wooden tub where the Monks made bread!  One good piece of advice: stay well clear of the place on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday. Cruise liner ships come in at 4pm with tourists from all over the world to be taken see the Cave of the Revelations and Monastery. You won't see much it gets very crowded and if you light a candle when you're not looking a monk will put it off. Mornings are best for both places. Dedicate each some time as they are unique!!",27-Aug-15
Burtdol,A MUST MONASTERY TO VISIT!,50,This monastery and the Cave where St. John wrote biblical accounts were fascinating to visit and see. The Greek Orthodox services at the cave are really inspiring to see if you are lucky to be there at that time. The Monastery holds actual pages of his writings and this is a real inspiration for all Christians to view!,19-Sep-16
calkiwi2,Must see while on island but watch the hours,50,Check hours of opening. Currently 8:00 AM to 1:30 PM with Saturday's also includes an evening opening.  Dress and act appropriately.,11-May-17
Carol S,Monestary - Monastics,50,"A glimps into the ancient world of the monastics - Quite amazing! The religious art, fortress like architecture and observing the monks performing Holy Week services was life changing.",4-Jun-14
ChaletSchoolFan,Beautiful place,50,"We travelled here from Samos. Our holiday rep advised organising our own transport rather than taking the set tour and she was right. We travelled by Flying Dolphin and arrived at Patmos at 9am. The local bus met the boat and meant we reached the monastery as it was opening and so it was very quiet and peaceful and we had a chance to talk with one of the monks.    We strolled back down to the port by footpaths, stopping at the Cave of the Revelation on the way. This visit was one of the highlights of our holiday and we had no objections to paying the 4E entry fee, which included the museum containing the treasures of the monastery.",12-Aug-13
chandra shekar s,Nice one,40,We went to this place on our cruise tour to greece and turkey.Cabs are available from base to cave and here combined.You have to claimd difficult steps before reaching here.May be tiring for people.Great views from top.Museum also has lot of collections,4-Sep-15
chris t,Worth visiting for the sights and historical significance,40,"It's a stop on a lot of cruises, and it was a good visit, perfect for a day trip out. Just enough time to admire the views, the history surrounding the place, and get some nice walk and climb for the day.",24-Apr-13
CHRISA K,Unique,50,"it is really beautiful, you should visit this church.  the view from the top is breath taking and you have a lot to see and learn",17-Oct-17
ChrisS74,Not to be missed,50,"The Monastery of St. John is probably the only visit not to be missed on Patmos. As often, it may be better to visit with a guide in order to get some explanations.",30-Oct-16
chrissy0826,Worth the crowd and walking,50,"I have to say, the Monastery of St. John was more impressive than I thought it would be. The area is beautiful and the architecture, as well. Just wondering around was pretty neat. Wear comfortable shoes and bring water as there is a lot of walking.",13-Feb-16
Christiana H,Peaceful,40,"A very old, beautiful and picturesque monastery with an inside courtyard full of flower pots. It's situated on the top of a hill so you'll be needing comfortable flat shoes to reach the site. Make sure you visit by yourself and not as part of a noisy group in order to enjoy the peacefulness and beauty of the place, and make sure you find the time to visit the surrounding area, enjoy the view and take lots of pictures.",13-Aug-13
christy1030,Anticlimatic,30,We took the public bus up to the monastery. The view from outside the monastery and from the surrounding town was amazing. We liked that more than the monastery and that part was free. We were really disappointed because the chapel and courtyard are no longer free to enter. You have to pay to enter and now you get to see the Treasury in that price. The Treasury didn't really interest us and we thought we would get to see more of the monks and monastery itself but you don't. You only see the museum Treasury and the chapel. Not worth the money for us. The web site says modest dress required so I followed directions but there were people there wearing whatever and they didn't care (probably since they charge now).    You can walk on a very rocky foot path back down to town and it also leads you to the Cave of the Apocalyps. It was a pretty walk and all downhill.,15-Jul-13
chuckm750,"Rich history, special place",40,"Walking up to the monastery, couldn’t help but marvel in it being an active monastery—including watching a 97-year-old monk walking doing that hike comfortably. It was an impressive place of devout monks.  Be respectful and avoid photography—signs are clear where it’s prohibited.",2-Jun-19
coletteme,Amazing place,50,Very peaceful and beautiful Monastery. Definitely worth the visit and very peaceful to just sit in the courtyard after exploring the Monastery.,24-Sep-16
Colleen H,A beautiful place to visit,50,"There is a bit of a walk up the hill and the ground is uneven, so be prepared to take your time and wear comfy shoes. Monastery is stone, so can be a bit chilly inside, so you might want a jacket. Visiting here gives new meaning to the word ""antique."" Many religious artifacts that are hundreds of years old. Lots of places to walk around; many steps. Great photo ops! Loved hearing about the old wall paintings (mural) that had even older paintings under them!",17-Apr-17
Connern,Superb Experience,50,Wanted to visit the Monestery for a long time and did this as independent travellers last week. Used the bus service which was very reliable and great value. Walked around the walled town which was fantastic and went into the Monestery and Museum which were top class. Lovely atmosphere and views to die for! Unlike many tourist places the town and Monestery were not tacky and exploited . Highly recommended .,13-Jun-15
Cookye4Sure,The Absolute Best!,50,"I highly recommend this place if you are interested in Bible History. If you was to visit the cave where John resided. If you want to stand in this HOLY Place, I truly recommend you Fly to Athens, take a ferry with a (room) so you can SLEEP. When you awake in the morning you will be on the beautiful island of Patmos. Find your way to this BEAUTIFUL place for worship and expierence this extraordinary and serene place.",24-Oct-18
Couture7,Top of the Hill,40,This was a very interesting and peaceful place to visit. We arrived near closing but had enough time to see the artifacts. The most intriguing things were the old manuscripts! They were beautiful and unusual. Great views from the upper galleries. Saw the sunset through one window and it was so beautiful! A great moment in the monastery.,7-Sep-13
Crazycruiser59,Glad I made the walk,40,"It was somewhat of a climb to get up to the monastery. Along the way, there are shops and small restaurants in the event you want souvenirs or a drink/snack. We were on a tour so we were given much history as we walked among the ruins. The site from above was fabulous. I would recommend good and comfortable walking shoes.",28-Dec-14
Croftonglazier,Stunning,50,"What a fantastic imposing building and well worth the three hour boat trip from Kos. So serene with the quiet only broken by the ringing of the monastery bells. Stay and sit awhile and enjoy fantastic views over the wonderful island of Patmos. Would recommend that you take the bus from the harbour up to the top of the hill, visit the monastery, and then walk down to the cave where St John wrote Revelation. Truly felt the presence of God and will definitely go back again someday.",10-Sep-14
CropsUK,Window on the past with a perfect view,40,Definitely worth a visit to see this ancient monastery where the Book of the Apocalypse was written - beautiful painted chapel and more artifacts to see in the onsite museum,27-Aug-18
csharp59,The view from the top of the Island,40,"If you are traveling to Patmos, it really is one of the main places you should visit including the Basilica of the Apocalypse (where John wrote the Book of Revelations around 90 AD). The monastery can be seen from almost any place on the island. Although this monastery did not exist when John was exiled to Patmos from Ephesus, it nonetheless will give you breath-taking views of the entire island. Because they have some very ancient frescos and religious artifacts in the museum, it is also fairly educational. It also was nice to actually see the monks going about their daily lives in spite of all the tourists coming through. As others have noted there are some restored windmills, and interesting architecture to see as well. Having a guide is not necessary, but a guide will provide you with more of the history if you don't research beforehand. Overall, a nice way to spend the morning!",27-Jun-13
cymopterus,A must visit while on Patmos,50,"It was founded in 1088 when the emperor in Constantinople gave the island of Patmos to a monk for the monastery. It is an amazing place overlooking the island. The old church has many interesting frescos and the museum has many treasures given to the monastery over its many years. My favorite was the purple codex, leaves of a 6th century gospel of Mark in Greek. My one disappointment was that the large library with many manuscripts was not open to the public. We took the bus from Skala and returned by bus after walking through Chora and to the windmills. A great morning.",4-Oct-17

David R,beware of the priest and monk,10,"We were followed around the entire time by the priest who was groping his gentiles and trying to lure us into a back room.

It was awkward and uncomfortable and a disgrace ,",1-Dec-17

Denise S,Items from antiquity,50,"The paintings, manuscripts, chalices etc are from various periods in antiquity ranging from the 5th century to the 18th century.

dragon789wv,"Worth seeing, esp. the Museum",40,"My wife and I were here on a Globus tour, and this was part of a 3-day cruise by Celestyal Cruise Olympia and tour is by the cruise ship, which included a trip to the Grotto (whoopeee!).    By the time we got to the Monastery, it was almost 7pm, and don't forget that DST kicked in a week earlier, so ... yeah, we got a lot of terrific shots on the outside! I am amazed at how a cruise ship DARES to charge people to visit the island 'attractions'.  To be honest, if I had known what the island's 2 attractions were, combined with the late hour of arrival to see the Grotto first (arrived there around 6:15pm) ,,, I would probably have skipped the whole tour from the cruise ship ... not worth the price.    However ...  If I were to break up the Monastery and the Museum, the Monastery would be a 3 and the Museum would be a 5.  I don't remember if they allowed photography inside the Monastery, but I think it was NO photography.  To us, the Museum -- Alert - no photography allowed! -- was most interesting. It had many items that were ... very intricate, very well done, and some were so small that you have to really look to see how well done and intricate the work really was. THAT to many of us on the tour was the highlight of the Monastery Shame we were not allowed photography so we could walk away with memories to show others - and have good memories.",1-Dec-18

drmommca,Meaningful experience,50,"After walking a steep, strenuous distance from the parking lot (not for the faint-hearted!), we first saw the cave where John experienced and wrote about his Revelation. This was awe-inspiring. Afterwards, we visited the Katholikon, which is the main church of the monastery which is still active. The Monestary was established in 1088. It and the adjacent museum are filled with ancient religious artifacts. Walking back down to the parking lot, you can stop at some of the shops along the way.

earnestxxxx,Interesting to contemplate,50,"This was a beautiful place and it was very interesting to contemplate John being in that area writing the Book of Revelations. The museum was interesting with I think the oldest bible ever...LOL, I don't know, but there can't be many much older! Very cool stuff! Beautiful ancient church.",25-Mar-15
easylacer,A steep walk up to a beautiful place,50,We visited Patmos whilst we were on a cruise. The walk was graded 2 but should have been a 4 as there are lots of steps up to the monastery and its not easy for people who find walking hard. The monastery is very interesting and worth the walk. The museum is also worth a visit. The guide books are very informative.,12-Dec-13
Eddie D,Awesome,50,"We visited the cave where St. John received the Book of Revelation in the Bible. Whether you're a believer or not, one can't help but be moved by the location and the story told by the tour guide. Then you go up to the monastery and see the ancient frescoes and the attached museum. And as you walk down the hill after the visit there are cafes and shops to meander in. Truly a wonderful afternoon.",16-Sep-18
Eddiemack,A UNESCO World Heritage Site!,40,"I had never been to Patmos but after doing my research, noted that everything there was to see was within close proximity to where the ship tenders would drop us off. It's a small island (about 13 sq. mi.) with a population of about 3,000 people. We stop here because in 1999, the island's historic center Chora, along with the Eastern Orthodox Monastery of St. John and the adjacent caves of the Apocalypse were declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. It is believed that John, one of the 12 Apostles, was exiled to Patmos and this is where he wrote the Book of Revelations. He lived in a cave, the place where he received a Revelation from Jesus. Therefore, Patmos is an important Christian pilgrimage destination.",26-Oct-16

ELear,Winter opening hours,50,"If you go in winter, be sure before you set out that you'll be able to get in. When I went, in December, the monastery museum, which was my main reason for coming, turned out to be closed to visitors and I could only really see the outside.",7-Apr-14
Elenhin,Intriguing history and mystery.,50,A long hot walk up a tonne of stairs paid off well in this monastery. It was beautiful and you could feel history within its walls. The museum was very special and interesting. I recommend covering your shoulders and knees to show respect for the people who live and work here.,29-Jul-15
Eleni_gak,History and religion in one,50,"This monastery is combining the history and the religion and is devoted to Saint John who wrote the apocalypse in the holy cave some km away from the monastery. The monastery is among the sites of World Heritage of UNESCO, and only for this it is worth visiting.",17-Jun-15
Elias_Alpha,You must visit this place,50,"If you are in Patmos, even for just 1 day like us, you must visit the monastery.    The church is so beautiful with amazing frescos and icons and fantastic views from the outside. The museum is also very interesting.    It is worth having a tour guide who would explain everything in detail and you can learn a few things!    Definitely worth a visit.",6-Aug-19
elitsana,Exquisite!,50,The Monastery of Saint John the Theologian is a holy place. The atmosphere inside is remarkable. One must feel it by himself.,31-Jul-13
ErinKouvas,So worth it for the spiritually inclined.,50,"It's been more than a few years since I've been to the Monastery of St. John but looking back it's definitely been one of the most memorable experiences on the islands.    Besides delicious food and heartfelt people...and the water of course....when traveling to Greece you must visit the churches. There are so many you can't help but continually stumble into one. But this...you can absolutely feel the weight of the place. It demands respect and awareness, you can't help but feel otherwise while here.    I would definitely make the trip again.",25-Nov-15
Eva172018,Saint John Monastery,40,This place will leave you feeling at peace with yourself. Retrace the steps of Saint John’s journey on the island of Patmos will leave breathless. The monastery has many old artefacts and is located on top of a mountain. The best time to go is in the morning because it is not often open during the afternoon.,10-Oct-19
evans81051,"Very Byzantine, Best Views of the Island",50,"If you're interested in everything Byzantine, you will love the Monastery of St. John.

Gaijin-tanuki,Well worth the visit,50,"Moderately steep climb from taxi rank. Beautiful, minimalist, Greek Island architecture. The museum displays an original El Greco.    From Skala a public bus runs to Chora hourly: €2 per person one way. If there is a small group, I recommend a shared taxi from Skala port: Cave of the Apocalypse (30 minutes to explore), then the Monastery (1 hr to explore) and return to Skala. €40 per cab.",10-Jul-17

Gary C,A must visit for any bucket list,50,"We were there with a small group, but there were many other groups there. Still we could see all if we were patient. The small chapel is full of paintings which are magnificent. The museum on the second level holds rare sacred scriptures, very impressive icons, and sacred items such as crosses, garments, and church vessels. It is a bit of a walk to get in, but you are rewarded with great views of the sea and the towns.",2-Jun-17

globalpgm,worthwhile,50,"I recently stopped here on a cruise and hiked from the port to the Monastery, down to the grotto of St John, and back to the port for lunch.

GreatDaysInParis,A special spiritual place,50,The cave where the Apostle John is said to have written the Book of Revelation is set within a monastery about halfway up the hill from Skala to hilltop Hora. Don't go when a cruise ship is in! Take the time to soak up the atmosphere.,6-Oct-17
h20skiguy,Don't miss it.,50,"Don't miss their page from the Purple Codex. It is the 2nd oldest bible in existence. Unfortunately the pages are supposedly scattered over 7 countries. Still, they have 33 pages here. Only one is on display.",27-May-15

houstontravelingfool,See the cave of St. John too,40,"We took the city bus to the monastery, walked around and then walked down the seemingly million-rock pathway to the cave of St. John. Be careful if you decide to walk. It's a long way and very uneven but we were glad we did. The cave was larger than expected and there are a lot of (steep) steps to climb getting there. We took a taxi back to the port and there seemed to be many available once you leave the cave. Definitely a worthwhile trek.",11-Oct-15
Hyphen1954,Old world religion,50,A great experience and must visit place. Just incredible to see the extensive collection of religious artifacts not to mention the building and altars. They are exquisite. Allow a couple of hours to take it all in. One of the key reasons to visit Patmos.,22-Mar-19

Ian K,A truly magnificent place,50,What a spectacular setting - right on topof a high hill on this special island. The chapel alone is worth the visit - so ornate. The refectory has a huge dining table. The bells are wonderful. Loved it!,28-Oct-19
Ignotus,Place(s) of Faith,50,"Patmos is associated with St John, author or the Gospel and Epistles that bear his name and also of the Book of Revelation. One need not be a believer to appreciate the Monastery - and the Cave where tradition has it he wrote Revelation. Of the two, the Monastery is more profound. High on a hill, it includes an ancient chapel decorated in the Orthodox style, with some of the oldest frescoes of their type int he world. There is also a fine museum containing treasures of the Monastery. As with many sites in Greece, it's best to read up before visiting to understand the historic significance of what you're seeing.",10-Nov-16
InaLyudmilova,Medieval monastery,50,"Back in time, you are feeling yourself like back in a times of Templiers. Amazing building on the top of the hill , where you can see the sea.",16-May-16
indianadoug,A must see for Patmos,50,Much of the history of Island is here as well as honoring the Apostle John's time as prisoner on Isand and the writing of Revelation of Jesus Christ - N.T. Book.,8-Aug-16
inyongh743,"An awesome fortress monastery, still functioning",40,"It really looks more like a fortress than a monastery from below the hill, but inside, you can see some wonderful frescoes and see that it's still very much a functioning monastery. This also means that you're not allowed to take photos in any indoor spaces, including the surprisingly extensive museum they have there. The views you get from the top all they way down the rest of Patmos and the sea are also wonderful. As always, make sure you are dressed modestly. There is a bus that takes you all the way up to Chora from Skala, but it still involves a bit of a walk. If you don't mind a bit more exercise and sweating profusely, you can also walk up from the Cave monastery, which was nice!",18-Aug-20
IrishWanderlust96,Interesting Place,40,The monastery is very nice and has a fantastic collection of religious artefacts. The chapel and frescoes are also very nice - it is well worth seeing when you’re on Patmos.,23-Jul-18
IsabelaC133,Disappoint !!!,10,Originally was only a cave. Now a small church is over the cave.  Not much to be seen unless you are a very religious person.  Overall the island was a big disappointment also.,27-May-13
isdn4u,Worth the Ride Up the Hill,40,The Monastery of St John actually turned out to be more interesting than we expected. We took a taxi up. No real need for a tour. It's a short ride that included a stop at the cavern where John wrote Revelations. Nice little village on top... a lot of steps that seemingly go upward forever. But the monastery is beautiful and peaceful. Nice views of the Med from on top as well.,15-May-17
Ismetser,Must see,50,When in patmos you must see this place because there isn't much to do here. It is a very beautiful place. They have great little shops. Do not forget to put decent cloths on,4-Jun-16

JEFFREY S,Incredible Experience,50,"Dominating the peak of Patmos, the Monastery of Saint John is incredible. On an island as small as Patmos, all roads lead to the Monastery. Once you arrive, there is an excellent patio restaurant to the right, and the path to the Monastery to the left. Ancient stone stairs lead the way to courtyards, small shops and a delicious bakery. Homes surround the Monastery, accessed by stone paths are ancient and beautifully kept.    The Monastery has posted hours, strictly enforced as it is primarily a Monastery and secondarily a UNESCO Heritage Site. Again as an active Monastery, monks live on the premises. Appropriate dress and behavior are expected. No photos are allowed in the Church or museum.    That being said, it is an incredible experience. Having weathered the political and international changes, the Monastery reflects the history of Greece as well as the Greek Orthodox faith. It is advisable to read up on the history of Greece under the Turks, Venetians, the Ottoman Empire as well as other visitors to Greece to appreciate the Church and museums artifacts.    Take your time, enjoy, and check the scheduled hours.",20-Jul-17
Jewelsworld,Do not miss the museum!!! Astounding collection.,40,"Seeing the working monastery, especially the museum, was almost worth the incredibly scary boat ride over from Kusadasi. I’d recommend waiting for ferry season. We went in April and had to contract with a tiny rattle-trap of a rickety boat that listed left the entire trip and then was swamped most of the way back to Kusadasi. So glad I don’t suffer from motion sickness but that was not true for most of our little group. I’m thinking that if the ride had been that rough going to Patmos, we’d all still be there because nobody would have risked getting on that boat again. Anyway, that being said, the monastery is pretty incredible. Especially the museum. It contains some religious artifacts such as the Purple codex, an el Greco painting and a 15th century icon by Andreas Ritzos. Quite incredible collection. Once done at the monastery, the views of the Aegean and Patmos from just outside the doors are stunning.",19-May-19
JimL_120612,Almost magical!,50,"St. John's Monastery in Chora had somewhat of a magical feel to it. The tour itself wasn't all that long and you couldn't see much of the Monastery, but there's such a calm and peaceful energy about this place. You can walk around the town of Chora, visit some of the shops, check out the local artists (incredibly talented by the way), eat some fantastic food and drink some great wine, no matter where you are in Chora and around the Monastery, it's just peaceful. There some pretty amazing views and the architecture is like none other. We spent some time conversing with one of the monks as he blessed a prayer cloth for us. People are amazingly friendly. We met a local artist who produced phenomenal pieces. She took us up the road a bit to a great restaurant with fantastic views with the nicest owners who talked to us about local history, etc. It was honestly my favorite place on our honeymoon visit.",8-Oct-13

Johnsid1,Worth the Visit,50,The monastery is dedicated to Apostle John who wrote the Book of Revelation.  There's a church and a museum. It's located in the town of Chora (Hora) which is very picturesque and worth spending a least a few hours to roam around its narrow cobble stoned streets.,21-Oct-15

jpapa4444,Interesting place to visit,40,It was nice to go up and see it. Very interesting site. We didn't go with a tour so you may learn quite a bit more if you do join a tour. You should get a drive to get you closer to the location unless you want to go for quite a walk.,6-Jun-17
KajL_12,The fine and remote location make this tempting,50,"Who ever visits Patmos, should also visit this monastery. Here is a lot of the ancient history of europe, and the western world entangled and collected in one and the same place. And one of the corner stones of Christianity.",7-Sep-17
Kameel M,The Museum is Worth a Visit,50,"This monastery has a commanding view of the island of Patmos; a grand Orthodox chapel.

KarumbaSantaFe,Impressive fortress,40,"The Monastery is a huge complex but only a small portion is open for viewing. No photos inside the church. You can only enter one of the 10 chapels. Many of the frescos are in poor shape but they are still a beautiful sight. Mostly, it is wandering through the open courtyards and admiring the architecture and the views of the island. There is a gift store. There is an entrance fee of a couple Euros. Dress appropriately or borrow the clothing from the hangers. You can take a taxi to Chora or a tour package.You have to walk from the dropoff point to the MOnastery which includes many steps. You wander through the town of Chora to get to the Monastery and there are numerous shops/restaurants along the way. We walked from the town of Skala some of which was on the road and some on a cobbled path. The path takes you also to the cave of the apocalypse.",28-Sep-15

kerryA899,Great views,40,We cycled from town to the monastery and we were unprepared for the steep climb to the top. After recovering we enjoyed the spectacular views towards the coast and then the nice roll back to the town. Worth a visit if you are in Patmos,20-Sep-15
kfifane,Beautiful mystical place,50,"One of the most mystical monasteries I have seen. Beautiful.  There is the mainchurch, other chapels. the Museum.

kimf992,Monastery,30,"Cool building. No a good place to see if you have difficulty walking.

kisdeszk,The Monastery Museum is excellent,40,"I recommend to go to monastery from Scala by local bus (1.5e) and after visiting the great museum with interesting artefacts from even the 11. century you could walk to another must see in Patmos, the Cave of St. John.

On the up side, there are some decent shops on the climb up hill.",15-Aug-15

We took a taxi from the port taxi rank - takes around 5-10 minutes to drive up - then walked up a short narrow street to the monastery. Not extremely steep and quite short, but definitely not a stroll - would be a big struggle if you have mobility problems.    Nice little shops around, also a cafe with an amazing view.    In terms of the monastery, it takes around 1 hour to look around. There are outside spaces and also the inside museum part. All very fascinating. A working monastery, closed in the afternoon.

It still has monks there but it is interesting having a look around and particularly going into the small museum they have there. Just be wary of the opening times. It is open from 8:00am - 1:30pm every day but is closed in the afternoon on Sunday, Monday, Wednesday and Friday and open from 4pm - 6 or 7 pm on the other afternoons.",21-Jun-15
Mi-Dan20,Worth the Visit,50,"Well worth the visit, interesting and inspiring, lots of relics, exquisite frescoes, religious art, the treasury and the museum are worth the visit. Lots of steps as built as a fortress, yet worth the visit to be at the site where it is said St. John wrote the gospel and received the visions of the last book of the New Testament.",23-May-14
Mina P,Fantastic crown on Patmos capital Chora,50,"No vehicles are allowed in Chora. So, if you take a bus from the port, you'll walk enough uphill from the bus stop to the Monastery. If you have your own car, you must arrive very early to find a parking place on the hill, otherwise you'll be obliged to park your car very far away from the Monastery. Take care NOT to park on the bus parking area, otherwise you'll face a very big problem.  You must be decently dressed with shoulders and knees covered.  Founded by St.Christodoulos in 1088, after the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I.Komninos gave him as a gift the whole island of Patmos, the monastery looks like a Byzantine castle. From that period only some pieces on the floor are authentic together with some pillars.  The monastery's height is 15m. Above the main entrance there is a small opening from where the monks poured hot oil or water on the pirates or other intruders. It's called ""the murderer""!  The inner courtyard is covered with pebbles and stones. Next to it the main church, where no photos are allowed. The highlight is a wooden iconostasis since 1820, hand made by 12 sculptors from Chios island.  Outside the church there is a stone wine basin and four arches above the courtyard. There are 7 different chapels inside the monastery area and another 3 outside its walls. On first floor what's left from an old stone oven and a wooden trough for the bread dough. Next to the oven there is a museum with a collection of old icons, original Bible manuscripts, priests robes, etc. Photographs are allowed in the Museum.  The view towards the port and generally Patmos island is really unforgettable.",21-Jul-19
Moa S,Stunning!,50,This is a must see if you are in Patmos!! Lovely temple allowing you to walk around among the priests in this stunning setting!,13-Sep-17
moosemanOU,Pretty cool,50,Slightly creepy but meat to see the cave where church tradition says John wrote Revelation. Weird that no pictures are allowed but still worth going to see!!,25-Jun-16
mountaintrekker1234,Must go to the Monastery,50,"The Monastery is a must to see and it is hard to miss. It sits atop the Island of Patmos, where the story goes that John the Theologician wrote the Book of Revelations. The Cave is important to see too.",8-Jul-17
MrPokey,Interesting and worthwhile visit,40,"Interesting site. Working monastery and museum with a well presented collection that is well captioned. Some superb individual items such as a tiny 1,000 year old icon and 1,500 year old ecclesiastical fabrics.",15-Jun-15
Muzzall,great to look at,30,impressive to look at from outside but once inside although theres some good historical bits theres not too much to do. was a bit disappointed by the inside. still is a must see. as a working monastery you can understand why only few bits are open,10-Sep-15
Myidea62,St. John woz ere,40,"Enjoy the history, told to be quiet, and not to talk loud.... 2 minutes later the same guy meets a friend and heard him chatting away 2 floors below... It's a chuch matey, practice what you Preach.......",4-Jun-15
Myra N,Interesting monastery,50,We went here a few times during our stay. Great views from the top over Scala. Lots of little shops and a good few wee tavernas there. Great lunch spot and dinner at sunset looking out to the windmills and sun setting. Easy to get taxi there and back as they are parked at bottom of monastery . We enjoyed our meal at sunset and would return again.,19-Jun-16
mzzlol,Yes another Must!,50,"See and feel where St John wrote the book of Revelations. This island itself offers beautiful views, but the monastery is a must.  This is a hefty hike and can not be done by everyone. If you have bad knees or feet you can make the hike it will just take you some time.",21-Sep-15
Nadide Mine M,very impressive,40,This is the place to be seen for sure. The whole place is full of wonderful points. The only problem is the visiting hours. They are very limited by the day and time.,9-Nov-18
Natlovestravel,Great place to visit,50,Must see during your Patmos visit. The view from there is beautiful. The monastery is pretty too. They have a very proud cat.,6-Aug-19
NatMcN,Brave monk stays open despite COVID,50,"I find this quite moving, that the head monk chose to stay open to tourists despite the threat of the virus to him and his elderly peers. Since they don’t charge admission, it’s not for the revenue. I’m grateful we could visit.",21-Aug-20
ninorobakidze,Just Beautiful <3,50,"Loved this place, you feel the breath of history, of sea and you feel the sun.  Absolutely beautiful place, with picturesque views on island.",26-Jun-17
NORMEDW,Hilltop views over Patmos.,40,"Arrived at Patmos from a cruise ship tender to the island and what a lovely setting the surrounding countryside has with coastal seashore and crystal clear waters and high hills upon which the monastery of St. John stands overlooking the town. We decided to try the local bus up to the monastery and this allowed us enough time to wander through the backstreet shops and parts of the town to get a feel for the place. Now if you try and get a bus in Greece then you will be aware that you don't tend to queue and rather push your way on and once the bus is full you go even ahead of schedule.  The cost per person is around 2 euros one way and takes about 25 minutes or so to drop you adjacent to the monastery / village around it and be sure to find out when the buses return. A steep climb is required through winding streets with cafes and little shops to reach the monastery but there is a reasonable amount of shade to be had from the buildings, although the streets are uneven underfoot. The monastery is well preserved and looked after and is free to visit but certain areas are not allowing photography at all. The views from both the monastery and certain viewpoints are stunning and a little cafe/restaurant we went to for a thirst quenching beer on our exit had as nice a panorama from it's terrace as you are likely to encounter. Worth a visit then and don't forget some walked up to the monastery from the town but in 32c we took the bus.",29-Sep-15
Norwegian_Fred,A must see,40,The monastery with its history and museum is a must whether you are christian or not is an amazing experience. Such a history.,3-Aug-14
Ofer B,Interesting museum.,50,The monastery is very nice to walk around and the small museum is very interesting especially the El Greco painting.,18-Sep-18
OriginalMurph,The view is worth the climb up.,40,"We did a bike ride around the island, starting with an assent of the hill that the Monastery is on. Since it was time for a break we decided to check it out; be warned that there is an admission charge (my receipt said 4E). The views from the front are spectacular, followed by a set of steps into the Monastery. Despite the foreboding posture like a fort at the top of the hill (since given when it was built everything needed to be built like a fort), it is actually pretty quaint inside. Nice courtyard opening into different sections, with lots of contrasting shadows.",26-Jul-13
OTR_Again_IM,Massive Monastery w/excellent Views,40,"This 11th century stone monastery was impressive even in the distance as we docked in port. At first it appears more like a massive Moorish fort sitting atop a high hill in Spain. The museum inside the monastery has some very ancient relics, beautifully decorated old manuscripts and Byzantine frescos. There were panoramic views of Patmos, our ship docked in the harbor and other far islands from the monastery. We also got some very good photos of the three functioning Patmos windmills with their very distinctive sails from the monastery's front steps. St. John's Cave of the Apocalypse is close by.",25-Oct-14
OTT12,A place you must visit!,50,"The monastery sits on top of Chora the capital of Patmos island and it is a must visit whether you are religious or not.  Dedicated to St. John who wrote the Book of Revelation is perhaps one of the most important monasteries in the Christian religion and also a very important Byzantine building and architecture.  You can take a bus or taxi to get to the top or even walk if you are fit and have the time.  As with all religious sights dress sensibly.  The entrance fee is modest and it also includes entrance into the museum which contains some of the most important artefacts and scriptures of the Eastern Church.  The Byzantine frescos are simply superb.  After the visit enjoy the view over the island and don't forget to have a walk around the picturesque streets of Chora.  You must not miss the monastery, it's a hugely moving experience.",31-Aug-13
PacoH_11,A fascinating contact with biblical history,40,It is very special to feel that we have touched the story if the bible and the book of revelations. Good visit,1-May-17
PacoH_11,Pilgrimage or not ...,50,"Whether you want to explore as a pilgrim to understand the story if St John the Evangelist, or simply to see how an ancient hermit lived and wrote Patmos is the place to do so.",9-Sep-15
PamC54,Lots of history and icons,40,This was a well preserved monastery which was founded in 1088. Our tour guide was well informed and explained many things about the chapel and the museum which made it interesting.  There is a very old manuscript (6th century AD) of the book of Job in the museum.,7-Oct-16
PAnne2016,Okay,30,"A bit disappointing, in that one doesn't get to see much of the monastery itself. However, the museum has some very interesting items, so that part was good, if you like history.",8-Jun-18
Paul O,Truly an unforgettable experience,50,This is one of those very special places where your mind needs to capture all the images set before you since no photography is allowed in the chapel. The chapel could only hold about a dozen and a half people and was a very intimate space but just as majestic as the Vatican. I will always remember the details of the carvings; the dark ceilings stained by centuries of incense and the paintings depicting scenes from the Bible. It was definitely a high point of our trip to the Aegean and the island of Patmos,17-Oct-15
Paul141,Very nice,40,"We caught the bus up, and walked back down. Very nice place with massive views. Little stone streets surrounding easy to get lost in.",6-Aug-17
Peter G,Church service and patmos island,50,I was lucky enough to take part in a church service in September 2015 and it was the most amazing experience of my life. I am greek orthodox so that helps obviously. Some of the rooms kept private from the masses were very special to see with my own eyes. During that particular service we arrived at 7am in the morning and were greeted by 4 monks hitting a very long plank of wood that was used to denote the start of the liturgy and to summons people to prayer (I snapped a picture). A beautiful practice to experience.,11-Jan-16
Peteski2016,Beautiful World Heritage site that dominates Patmos,50,This is a must do in Patmos - you must get to this world heritage site. The view is amazing and there are restaurants and coffee shops where you can stop before or after your visit. We took a bus from town - cab available as well - and enjoyed the walk down. Beautiful view. Lots of history and stories here - museum is excellent. This is a living working monastery so dress with respect. We saw someone getting told off. No pictures inside. Amazing.,2-Oct-17
Petros H,"Quite a nice place, seen much better",40,"Architecture and ikones quite interesting. The place it was initially built as a fortress at the top of the island's highest rock, makes it more interesting. Beautiful views.",14-May-19
Pnoy65,Visiting Hours of the Monastery @ Patmos,40,"The monastery is located on top of the hill accessed by riding a cab, bus, or walk - actually saw some tourists walking up and down the hill. If you have the time waiting (1 - 2 hours) for the bus, fare is 1.50 euro while the cab round trip fare is 30 euro (I could have gotten for 20 euros). Don't forget your camera. Building is impressive, The view from the top looking down is superb, too! Inside the museum are original books - I consider priceless, especially the Book of Job (no cameras allowed).",10-Jun-13
quasimodo43,"Christian or not, the Monastery & the Cave of the Apocalypse are unmissable.",50,"I suggest taking the bus from Skala up to Hora (1.5 euro) visiting the monastery and then taking the downhill 4 km. Byzantine pilgrim's trail back to Skala which passes St. John's Cave of the Apocalypse. Whether you're a Christian or not, both are unmissable, but keep in mind that you'll need to be reasonably fit.  The fortified monastery allows spectacular views over the island and the museum library houses some truly beautiful and rare manuscripts/icons/liturgical robes/jewelled chalices and a great deal more. The Cave of the Apocalypse, where St. John is reputed to have written the Book of Revelation, is downhill a kilometre or so and is a place of reverence and wonder - even for this atheist. Entry to both is very reasonable and helps towards their maintenance. Tip: please respect the ""no photo"" request, The Cave of the Apocalypse is particularly vulnerable to flashlight and the noise of digital cameras.",27-Sep-14
RachaelVW,It's a beautiful place!,50,"If you are lucky enough to be sailing around the Greek Isles or just lucky enough to be visiting Patmos, take the time to tour the monastery. It's fascinating in all sorts of ways that include history, art and religion.",28-Jul-16
RAMWashington,Worth a visit!,50,"The monastery and the cave were the two main reasons we came to Patmos. The monastery was beautiful and had a nice museum. While we were there, one of the priests stopped by and said to my wife: ""You look very peaceful and happy."" She replied, ""I am.""    He stayed talking with us for quite a while, telling us some about his past and about his philosophies. Very interesting!",1-Nov-13
RealEstateScorecard,Step back in time,40,So glad chose to visit the monastery. One can't help but be in awe of the significance of this holy place surrounded by a quaint village. The museum inside holds priceless artifacts. The entrance cost is minimal - 4 euros. Cats roam the streets. There are a couple cafes and shops within the monastery walls to explore. We took the local bus from the port which costs 3 euros each and caught a taxi back down for 10 euros.,24-Jun-16
RichardK938,Most Important Monastery,50,"Make the trek up the hill to see this monastery dedicated to St. John. it has a very ornate orthodox church, a courtyard, monks quarters and stunning views of Patmos Island and the surrounding islands. Get a guide because there is not other way to appreciate the importance of this place while walking through it",29-Oct-17
riseparkpair,Stunning,50,"Just 4 euros, and the monastery is well worth it. Spectacular views also, as it is on the highest point on the island. A "" must see "" is the museum. Artefacts from centuries ago, beautifully displayed. One tip, if driving, car parking can be a problem. Skala bus takes you there in a few minutes. Taxi 8 euros.",10-Jul-19
roaming_kiwi58,Probably the highlight of Patmos,50,"We were in Patmos for just a half day from a cruise ship. We did a tour which took us on a short drive around the island, stopping at the Cave of the Apocalypse and St John's Monastery.  The Monastery sits in a prominent position in the middle of the island. There are good views looking up to the monastery and also good views looking down when you get up there. The monastery looks more like a castle.  Modest dress is requested in the monastery, so cover your knees and shoulders. You are not allowed to take photos inside the museum, which is full of interesting artifacts. There is a short climb up the path to get into the monastery from the road where the bus dropped us off.  There are currently 16 monks living here.  Interesting place and definitely worth visiting.",4-Oct-19
Robert S,Worth a visit,40,Part of a cruise package and is a must for all visitors to Patmos.Excellent views and a good ambience in the village.,29-Sep-15
Rockport4,Beautiful Monastery,50,"After visiting the grotto where St. John was said to receive visions that dictated the Book of Revelations, we next visited this monastery. There is a bit of a climb to reach it so comfortable shoes and modest dress are both requirements. It is well worth the climb as there are wonderful frescos and a beautiful courtyard to just sit and meditate. There are also beautiful views from this fortress which was built to protect it against marauding pirates.",16-Oct-16
Ron R,Beautiful monastery.,50,"This the most imposing building on Patmos, being so large and situated on the highest point. The Greek architecture is well worth visiting for.",2-Jan-18
ronit182,A must see,50,Visiting patmos without going to this sacred place is meaningless. The church is a jewel by itself and the stunning part of the monastery is the museum rich in icons frescos and many other church items.,27-Apr-19
Rosalie P,Fascinating museum,50,"Situated on top of a hill in the old town, a really interesting old building, church with ancient frescoes and a museum.  Only 4 euros entrance fee and lots to see, some really interesting things. Also very worth while walking round the old town outside for really quaint little narrow streets.",14-Sep-18
rosalin101,Well worth a visit,50,"We were ready to dismiss this monastery as just another site, but it rreally is a lovely place. Breathtaking views, cool quiet courtyards, well tended pots of plants as well as antiquities, 'bling' and buckets of history. Don't miss it",12-Oct-14
Rose S,A VERY SPECIAL PLACE,50,"The Monastery of St.John is definitely worth seeing IF you are a religious and or history buff.    Of course, be sure to read about Patmos BEFORE embarking on your trip in order to get the most out of it. Do research. There's nothing worse than seeing these hugely historical sites and not understanding what you are seeing. Or, pay for a tour-guide.    The cave is the actual place where John of Patmos, wrote the book of the Revelation prior to 100 AD. You'll see a stone with a deep inlay where he wrote about his visions. Can you imagine the Voice of God coming to you coming to you from a rock? How would John have felt about it alone in this cave?    The church came later. So did the wall paintings and icons -- however, these are quite old from the beginning of AD to the 1500s. These too are well worth the trip.    The island is in the Aegean and in the height of summer the sky is a deep hue of blue.    One thing I would highly recommend is having a full water bottle.",26-Jun-13
SanFranciscoGuy634,Spectacular and Beautiful - Bali Hai,50,"You can see this historic monastery from many points in Patmos. It calls to you, like Bali Hai in South Pacific. Once you get close the rest of the pilgrimage is on foot through the historic surrounding town. This place has truly earned its  World Heritage Site designation. Do not miss it.",21-Oct-19
scouser1077,Highlight of our tour,50,"We had seen so many churches, cathedrals and monasteries we did not know what to expect. This is a wonderful place to visit if you ever get to this lovely city of Patmos. Very humbling, so much history beautiful location a pleasure to walk around without being hurried.",2-Nov-15
seattlesez,Monastery is a go but Cave is for super-devout only,40,"We rented a car at the place suggested by the cruise ship.  Keep your eyes open because it's easy to miss the turn toward the  monastery. Parking can be a challenge.    We made the Trek to the Cave but I have to say it was a mistake...  maybe half a mile down steps (and remember, you have to come back up!)    From the Monastery we went onto a pleasant lunch in Grikos.",12-Oct-15
serviceace,Top of the town,40,We took the bus up from the town and wandered up through the Chora until we reached the Monastery. On arrival a few people were sitting waiting and we discovered it didn't reopen until 1600hrs. Do check times if you are planning a visit. We are not particularly religious but we could appreciate the wonderful history of the monastery and the ornate chapel with the icons and artefacts. We also wandered through the museum which added to the sense of history.  Worth a visit and combine with a walk through the old streets and lanes of the Chora.,8-Sep-15
shadiatewfik,On the steps of St. Paul,50,During a trip with a group we visited this marvelous monastery. The location is hilarious that provides a panoramic view of the island. The church of the monastery is in perfect condition.,8-Sep-16
ShanthanS,"St. John's cave (Revelation of God), Patmos",50,We sailed via the Agean sea from Kusadasia to Samos and then took another ship to Patmos. Pythagoreion- Port in Samos has a difficult terrain and travelers should be aware of it. When travelling via ships and ferries it is better to limit your luggage as there are no trolleys in the ports. To visit St.John’s (Theologian) tomb it is better to go by taxi which will cost about Eur 5 oneway.  In Patmos we visited St. John's cave where he got the divine revelation. Patmos island is indeed a unique experience and good for relaxation.  Especially the Romeo hotel staff were very friendly (you feel like you are at home) and we had our daughter’s birthday celebrated in a wonderful day. Romeo hotel is a different style of rooms and is ideal for a summer vacation.  We arranged the whole tour from Turkey to Patmos and to Athens via Crossroads travels and would strongly recommend them for your tour as they are flexible and focused to meet customer’s expectations.,12-Aug-13
Sharon B,Nice castle like Byzantine structure,40,Patmos is the Jerusalem of the Agean Sea and the St. John's Monastery is definitely a must see. This huge structure looms in stark contrast to the gleaming white homes that rest below it's dark facade. It's quite amazing that the Monastery survived epic raids by Norman pirates in the 11th and 12th centuries.,24-Jan-16
Sheila C,AWESOME,50,It was just a surreal experience to visit the monastery of St. John and to know the history behind how the monastery was built. Enjoyed the tour very much,26-Aug-14
Sheila S,Beautifully decorated chapels,50,"We really enjoyed our visit, the interiors of the chapels were richly decorated & most impressive. It was a fascinating place to explore. Our guide gave us very good advice about taking photographs, don't even think about it inside chapels etc; but if you can see the sky above your head it is ok.",4-Nov-16
Sherrydarling,Beautiful place & informative museum,50,"We checked which day there would be no cruise ship in the port at Patmos & chose this day as our day to visit so that it would be less busy; in September this day was Monday. We look a taxi from the port which was about 8 Euros & we arrived at the monastery at 9am, there were no other visitors when we arrived. Dress needs to be respectful; my dress had short sleeves & covered my knees; my husband was wearing a short sleeved shirt & longer shorts.  The man at the ticket office gave us some helpful information & we had our own guide book which was useful for both the chapels & the museum. The museum is full of treasures; don't miss the top floor & the instructions to capture pirates!  After leaving the monastery we walked to the windmills, stopped for a coffee & then followed the path of culture down the hill, through tress with some shade, to the Cave of the Apocalypse. After visiting the cave we continued following the path back down to Skala, this took about 20 minutes from the cave. I think we were back at the port at around 1.15pm.",15-Sep-19
Simon W,VERY INTERESTING HISTORIC MONASTERY,50,"Very old - it possesses a charter from Emperor Alexios I Comnenos. Beautiful decorations on almost every available wall and ceiling, devoted to telling the Christian story and in particular the work of St John the Divine. Bear in mind that this is a religious house and so modest clothing is recommended.",28-Sep-19
skaliotis,A real gem Reaching for the Skies !,50,"The Monastery of Saint John the Theologian Build in 1088. World Heritage side.  A beautiful gem in the Aegean ! A must see side when on Patmos island.  It was build like a castle in order to defend it's self from the threats of piracy.  There are so many beautifully written manuscripts. Among it's relics the skull of Saint Thomas the Apostle and Saint Philip the Apostle.  you can see the monastery from every corner of the island, looks like it is touching the skies ! if you do not mind a climb, it's a beautiful walk, following a footpath from Skala to Chora. Walking through the narrow streets of Chora you can reach the Monastery.On your way Up, you can also visit the Cave of Revelations.  No photographs allowed inside at both the Cave and the Monastery.  Once up the top, you are surrounded by beautiful views of the island .  Outside the Monastery you can visit the small friendly coffee shop for a Greek coffee or a drink.  The best way to visit both sides is to go on your own and early,so that you can spend the time you need to absorbed all. My Soul was touched at both sides !  Looking forward to visit again in the future.",27-May-19
snezana9,Back to the past,50,The first thing you notice on Patmos is the monastery of St John the Divine or the Evangelist. It's nice to be a part of history at least in this way...A trip for us who stayed at Samos who is worthy and who is remembering...,5-Feb-18
Sorin D,Monastery,40,The Saint John Monastery has an important library; the museum is beautiful and very interesting (entry 6 euro). You can view some manuscripts of the first centuries of our era. The cave of the apocalypse also must be visited. The way to the monastery is not easy per pedes (the bus or taxi are recommended). Other monastery is Zoodochos Pigi.  Many restaurants in Mandraki.,12-Jul-13
soulefultraveler,Even if you don't like monasteries . . .,50,"This one is worth the trip. Wonderful location with fabulous views. Still a working monastery.

Steve_OldOkie,Historic,50,"Another stop with the Gate 1 Travel group, we visited the Patmos cave where it's reported St. John wrote his book.

togher64,Do the same walk,40,"Well worth the climb to the top of Chora (Hora) old town to see these amazing buildings, you will still see the priests going about their day. Please be respectful and ensure appropriate dress is worn, women cover shoulders and below their knees. £2 to enter the museum also worth checking out. After leaving take in the windmills, then follow the ancient path down to the grotto. Also only £2 for entry. However, ensure you visit between 830 and 1330 as these venues then shut. I believe in summer opening hours are extended.  There is also a bus service to the monastery, which runs morning and evening. If you should catch a cab be warned they don't appear to use meters, so negotiate price before departing.",5-Jun-15

travellistics,Small Museum,30,"If you happen to be in Patmos you should visit the Monastery . Great Views, Museum is Small but its the best thing to do in Patmos",16-Oct-15
Turigal,Incredible! You must see it to believe it!,50,"I always wonder how they built these huge churches and monasteries so many years ago, and this one is amazing! Check the times before traveling up to the monastery, since the hours change, but this is a must-see on this beautiful island!",18-Jul-15
U9606EJalexc,What an amazing place.,50,"A very challenging climb from Skala brings you to Chora, right at the heart of which is this wonderful monastery. Set in what looks like an ancient castle (which was built on the grounds of an even more ancient temple) it houses a beautiful church as well as a small museum, it is home to some extremely precious artefacts which are looked after by some highly knowledgeable people who are more than happy to share information.  Be respectful and cover up a little and you will be made to feel most welcome. Breathtaking views from the high points.  St John is all important to Patmos- a stay on the island would not be complete without visiting this monastery. (Check opening times - you don’t want to make the climb only to find it closed!)",24-Aug-18
VacationerGR-1978,Much more than just.... a must,50,"The Monastery of St.John stands above the village of Chora, like being the master of the island (which perhaps is). This Castle-Monastery has a unique architecture, offering breathtaking view to the whole island.  Inside you can visit the Holly Temple dated in the fifteen hundreads, enter the museum (ticket 2 euros) and see a magnificent collection of jeweled alices, crowns, Crosses, old writings dating back as far 1073, icons and religious paintings including an original El Greco.  I had the chance to visit this monastery twice during my stay in Patmos. The first visit was to see all those treasures, enjoy the view and architecture and light a candle at the church. My second visit was on Good Saturday night for Resurrection, on a great devotion. Simply unforgetable",11-May-13
Vagabondage,Physically challenging but wouldn't have missed it.,50,"As both a practicing Christian (Protestant) and a historian I had wanted for years to visit this site a millennium of pilgrims have regarded as sacred. I wanted to wait till we were retired and so could be there for Holy Week, as Easter is Greece's most solemn and festive celebration. Last week we finally did it and loved the experience.    The monastery itself, with its Byzantine architecture, wonderful frescoes, impressive lanterns, crosses, censers, chalices and the like, and its sonorous bell peals was very moving, as was watching many locals and pilgrims from afar kissing the icons and lighting candles for loved ones. The treasury/museum was impressive, with ancient manuscripts of Aristotle and Aristophanes as well as sacred documents, exquisite handmade liturgical vestments and icons including one said to be by El Greco. The day we were there, high school boys from Skala were carrying the monastery's icons throughout the surrounding neighborhood, followed by a kindly papa (priest) blessing every person and building. The central square was strewn with fragrant sprigs of Spanish lavender, which many of the locals and pilgrims took home bits of to hang in their homes or cars.    I have to say that as a person with mobility and cardiac issues (I temporarily use a cane and am prone to lightheadedness during exertion), getting up to the monastery and exploring the delightful historic village of Chora which surrounds it were quite difficult for me and required frequent pauses to rest. There are lots of steps and many uneven cobblestones. We were so tuckered out after we left that we took a 3 hour nap (!!), and four days later I am still stiff and sore. I frankly don't know if/how a person in a wheelchair could manage it.    But for us, the experience was more than worth it.",10-May-13
Victoria D,Patmos Highlights,40,"We visited the Cave of the Apocalypse and the Monastery. I am soooo glad we decided to to use True Greece's suggestion to do a tour. We had a private tour and it was so worth the money. Nikolaus, our guide, was so very pleasant, informed, and made the trip so interesting. There is an element you miss if you just visit these sites without a guide.    And the history and atmosphere of being in such a spiritual and historical place was a wonderful experience. Don't miss seeing this on your visit.",4-Aug-14
Villeneuve1959,Late season visit,40,"Understand that this attractioncan be very busy in the summer, but could soak in the atmosphere on a visit in mid-October with only one other couple there at the same time.  Impressive collection of ancient manuscripts and othe ecclesiastical treasures on display, and a few chapels possible to see, highly decorated with frescos of variable age. The building dominates the old town with a castle-like structure, but is interesting and quirky architecturally on the inside. Think they could have had more information on the monastic life that continues inside, but a must visit when in Patmos.",19-Oct-15
virginiatraveler2015,Beautiful paintings and great views,40,Lovely paintings adorn the walls outside the sanctuary. There were beautiful views as well. The museum had some very interesting artifacts. Even the hike up the hill was nice.,14-Aug-15
viviennenkeitha,Disappointed,20,Religious through n through Were is the Christian element its very hidden I feel this place is nice over the top & has a great view Go to the Cave 100 times better Not worth it in our opinion,26-Dec-15
VW49,Plenty to see in the monastery and museum,40,"Our visit was an excursion from a cruise ship which had several busloads of people converging on the monastery. But even with the crowd, it was well worth it to see the monastery and spend time in the museum which had excellent exhibits. As a bonus, we arrived late afternoon and the sunset views from the monastery/hilltop were so spectacular. Some uphill walking is required to get there.",26-May-16
wendy p,A very interesting visit,40,"This was a very quick stop as the group was also visiting other places on Patmos. Our guide was very good with a good clear voice, very informative. Quite a few steps to negotiate if you are thinking of seeing this cave.",6-Jun-15
WJD_CO,"Tremendous experience, Amazing Mammoth Structure Dominates the Hilltop",40,"This is worth the climb and visit. It sits on top of the hill, there are many shops and restaurants that have a great view of the port and sea, and it is simply a breathtaking and beautiful site with incredible architecture. Visit the cave nearby where John wrote the book of Revelation.",3-Oct-17
wmccfp,Worth the climb,50,Whether you're a fan of the ornate church or not the views are absolutely worth the walk up the hill. The town around the monastery is worth walking through to get a sense of simpler times and simpler lives. Easy to see why their was immense effort to bring materials up to build the whole complex.,10-Nov-17
wtpoohb,Beautiful,40,"This is a beautiful monastery atop the hill in Patmos. The building itself is amazing. The views are stunning. We had a wonderful tour guide leading us through the monastery. She was very informative. The only downside was the number of people in the building. The other tourists were just plain rude. We even had a lady attempt to push a couple of us out of her way so she could get in to see something. We were a group and her group was behind our group. I’m not sure if the massive crowds are common or just when we were there. It did make it difficult to really soak up the atmosphere with so many people. Overall, it was a wonderful experience.",4-Jun-18
X292EHchrisg,Must see,40,"A visit to the monastery and surrounding village of Chora is definitely a must when visiting Patmos.  Hiring a scooter is the best way to get there in the summer season as it's very hot walking up the hill. The monastery is in it's original state, and it's museum has very old chalkies and artefacts dating centuries. A maze of narrow streets takes you through the surrounding village. The views ate amazing. Look out over Patmos and the surrounding islands.",28-Sep-14
xxxasia,Worth a visit but not a lot open to the public,40,"Rather unfortunately we arrived at the same time as a large cruise ship from Cyprus full of pilgrims! So the place was noisy and heaving. The only parts open are the chapel and museum, both beautfully maintained with ancient frescos and artifacts. Some tips:  1. Bone up in advance about the history of St John, the Revelations, the building of the monastery and the development of the surrounding Chora (interesting for its successive influx of immigrants from Crete and Constantinople). Makes the experience so much more meaningful. We took a 3 guided hour walk up to the Chora in advance with Antonis Dimas - he does private tours in Patmos and was able to explain the whole history of the island in a most entertaining way.  2. Go early morning (open at 8 am) or late afternoon (closes at 6pm but not open every afternoon). Definitely avoid going just after a cruise ship has docked!  3. Take bus up, only €1.50 from the Skala bus stand at the port opposite the police station. The bus also picks up passengers en route at Grikos. Check bus timetable at very helpful tourist agent Astoria in main port (who also sells ferry tickets). From the bus you get wonderful views over both sides of the island.  4. Spend some time wandering through the alleys in the Chora. The main square has some bars and restaurants. Very atmospheric.  5. If you decide to walk down to Skala port, then wear shoes with good grip and take the old cobbled road which cuts out the hairpins. Lovely views down but slippery underfoot.  6. It is a working monastery with 15 monks. Women need to wear respectful clothing covering knees and shoulders. Men need to take off hats.",16-Jun-13
Yiannakis,Beautiful Monastery,50,"Beautiful Monastery that reveals so much Christian history. Founded in the Eleventh Century, this is a treasure of the faith. See the main chapel and the museum.  A basic understanding of Eastern Orthodox worship and theology would be tremendously helpful before going. A tour guide is recommended to ensure that you don't miss anything!",25-Jul-15
zebecToronto,A wonderful place to engage spirituality,40,"We were the first through the doors and although not Christian, had a special experience. We tried very hard to show respect throughout, not venturing where prohibited and whispering always in hushed tones. The Russian women who arrived a half hour after us did not seem to feel the same way and shouted to each other repeatedly across the property. I nearly confronted them for their arrogance. Of course, staff beat me to that. We would like to have reieved more respect from staff ourselves. They were vague when asked about liturgical services dates/times, despite the fact that we were renting a house from them. One male staffer on the main floor also mocked our efforts to document the property photographically, not realizing that we speak and understand a little Greek. Shame that both lookout vistas at the 'primahiolia' belfrey tower and also the museum terrace are now closed to visitors. They were once the amongst the very best sunrise points on patmos. Whatever. You will love this place especially if you come right at opening time. *The opening hours posted both on the large official poster just to the left of the entry and also reproduced in tourism pamphlets are incorrect. Perhaps this might be remedied by those in high places? *BTW, the 'Byzantine Icons' shop run by friendly Costas just at the bottom of the entry ramp sells top quality art reproduction souvenirs and more. His products include religious paintings done by actual monks themselves. Visitors may want to read Jeffrey Siger's 'Midnight in Patmos' crime novel beforehand. Take my advice and also give a listen to acoustic guitarist Don Ross' oh-so evocative masterpiece 'Patmos', from his CD 'Bearing Straight'. Genius. Also, know that the homes just behind the Monastery are the oldest quarter of Chora. Rumour has it that some very famous folks own holiday homes there, including Ziggy Stardust, Forrest Gump plus Erin Brokovich. I am done. The end.",13-Oct-14
